ACCURACY distance ALWAYS
	distance must be grater than 1 mm
	handy voor CP (continues path)

BRAKE
	now the front program is paused and BRAKE stops the movement directly and skips this movement to go to the next one

BREAK
	Robot will wait until done to go further. This will work a lot better than the WAIT_UNTIL_DONE.
	This also fucks with the CP controll so please read the Manual

DRIVE joint number, displacement, speed
	Moves a single joint of the Robot

DRAW X-translation, Y-translation, Z-translation, X-rotation, Y-rotation, Z-rotation, speed
	move the robot in lineair movement from the current pose and at specified speed based on the base coordinates

TDRAW X-translation, Y-translation, Z-translation, X-rotation, Y-rotation, Z-rotation, speed
	move the robot in lineair movement from the current pose and at specified speed based on the base coordinates

Look if C1MOVE, C2MOVE and XMOVE can be used without pose variables otherwise add global usable pose variables that can be overwritten
	use EXISTJOINT(joint displaement name) and EXISTTRANS(transformation value name) to check if they exist

BSPEED speed
	Can add speed to the speed by overcompensating for the screen set speed

RIGHTY and LEFTY
	gives more controll over the base rotation (JT0) with pose translations

ABOVE and BELOW
	gives more controll over elbow arm with pose translations

UWRIST and DWRIST
	gives more controll over the wrist with pose translations

IFPWPRINT
	to put custom text on teachpendant to show the last recieved command

SETHOME and SET2HOME accuracy, joint displacement values
	to set the HOME and HOME2 position from code

ULIMIT and LLIMIT

WEIGHT load mass, center of gravity location X, center of gravity location Y, center of gravity location Z, inertia moment ab. X, inertia moment ab. Y, inertia moment ab. Z
	sets the mass data of the tool and work

TPLIGHT
	to turn on the background light of the TP for 600 seconds

system switches
	ABS.SPEED
		might give more controll over speed

might be able to use EXISTINTEGER, EXISTCHAR, EXISTREAL and EXISTPGM to check if all the global variables exist before the AUTOSTART.pc starts running

ERRORS and ERROR
	gives back the error codeand number no known use case but it is interesting for figuring out stuff with error codes

TOOL tool1 and TOOL NULL
	add an option to the TOOL command to use the tool numbers that you can configure on the TP instead of giving the rotation point
