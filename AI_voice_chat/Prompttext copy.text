Our students will create a working prototype for your automation problem at no cost to you. The Hague University of Applied Sciences will provide the robots and cameras.

Information for students
In short
We're an elite minor programme for ambitious students who want to help out ambitious companies with  minor, machine vision and machine learning.
25 extremely motivated students from all technical disciplines
6 projects from industry involving  minor and vision
30 ECTS points – one semester
2 starting moments – in September and February

Studying at our Delft campus.

What skillset will you acquire
We'll help you get awesomely skilled with robots, vision and machine learning.
Industrial robot programming

Program one of our six Universal and Kawasaki robots and put them into your customer’s production line. The client company may require you use their own robot, oftentimes an ABB, Kuka or Fanuc robot.

Machine vision programming

Program our Cognex 2D cameras, Halcon machine vision software and Sick 3D laser sensors. You’re free to use any other technology you or the client company wants, as long as it helps you solve your problems. OpenCV is a popular free choice.

Machine learning techniques

We’ll help you employ machine learning algorithms to automate production decisions, depending on the requirements of your project and your own desires.

Industry-grade smart manufacturing skills

Your group will be assigned one or more highly skilled mentors with real-life industry experience.

What you will do from day-to-day
Your project group will get its own robot and project space in our lab.
You will be part of a project group of approximately four students.

Some of them will be from another technical discipline, another university or another country. There will be five more project groups in your semester.

You’ll be working on an actual company project.

We only do company projects. We will help you find companies who want to work with your project group, so don’t worry if you can’t find a good project yourself.

Our robot lab will feel like your home.

You’ll be spending so much time in our lab, that it will start feeling like your lab.

Borrel regularly.

To make sure you really feel part of a the SMR family we regularly organize after-work get togethers with food and drinks. In the best Dutch tradition it’s called a ‘borrel‘.

Collaborate a lot.

There are so many new technologies to master – we always make sure we have all the latest equipment – that some of you will specialize and provide their skills to other groups.

The focus is on the project.

Subjects are only there to help you master the skills you need to finish your projects. It’s extremely project oriented, so there are no b*llshit lectures that make you want to sleep.

How can you participate?
We accept the most ambitious technical students from all over Europe.

# Definitions

|||
--|--
**Client** | Your primary contact and problem owner from the company that submitted a Project opportunity.
**Project** | A project proposal that has been accepted by a Team. You will shape and execute the project in about two months time. Hard work but very rewarding.
**Project opportunity** | A Project proposed by a Company. Often still vaguely formulated. Not yet accepted by a Team.
**Rulebook** | Contains the official rules and guidelines for this minor programme.
**Team** | About 4 students that execute a project for a Client

# What will you learn in this minor?

In this minor you will automate two industrial manufacturing processes with industrial robots in a team of four students. We’ll help you do it.

# How does the minor work?

The minor is split into two parts:
1. **SMR1**: weeks 1 to 10
2. **SMR2**: weeks 11 to 20

The structure of both parts is as follows:

|Week|Minor|What
--|--|--
**1** |**SMR1**|Workshops
2 ||Workshops & project start
3 ||Project
4 ||Project
5 ||Project
6 ||Project
7 ||Project
8 ||Project
9 ||Project demonstrations & assessment
10||Re-exams (if you failed; otherwise free vacation)
**11**|**SMR2**|Workshops
12||Workshops & project start
13||Project
14||Project
15||Project
16||Project
17||Project
18||Project
19||Project demonstrations & assessment
20||Re-exams (if you failed; otherwise free vacation)

Most of the initial skills and knowledge are taught in the form of practicums/trainings before the project starts. But in all honesty, you only *really* start learning on-the-job during the project itself.

Oftentimes you will feel that you are missing a lot of the information you need to continue in the project. Just like in real life. This is exactly the time to go looking for information yourself. Remember: no pain, no gain.

# How will the project teams be formed?

You are allowed to form the teams yourself.

However, in SMR1 the minor coordinator will impose constraints on:

0. the minimum and maximum amount of students in a team to make it all managable
1. the internationals/locals ratio of a team to ensure an international environment
2. the mix of disciplines in a team to ensure a multidisciplinary environment

The minor coordinator may chose to impose such constraints in SMR2 as well if (s)he deems that necessary. That is unlikely however; in SMR2 you'll have a lot of freedom in composing your team. Team size will still be monitored though.

# What requirements will be placed on our solution?

For SMR1, your solution must contain all of the following elements (which will be provided by us):

1. **Industrial robot**
In consultation with the project coordinator you’ll choose a robot from our robot park. You may have to share a robot or use a simulator.
2. **End-of-arm-tool (EOAT)**
You’ll use an (often custom-developed) end-of-arm-tool. You can use our components. Within reasonable bounds, we’ll buy additional stuff you might need.
3. **Machine vision camera**
You’ll have to incorporate one of our machine vision cameras into your system.
4. **PLC** 
PLC with touch screen display or **Computer** with controller board and interface
During the demonstration you will not be allowed to touch your robot’s teach box. Instead, you are required to control the operation of your set-up through a display connected to a PLC. You can get an exemption on this rule, however you need to convince the coordinator with a good reason.

> Any rule - including the requirements above - can be broken, but only after prior consultation with SMR staff. Just talk to us if you have reasons to do things differently.

# Language: English or Dutch?

We’ll be speaking English whenever there are people in the room who are unable or unwilling to speak Dutch.

Written content should always be in English.

# Teaching materials

- A capable laptop (bring yourself)
- A maximum of EUR 50 in total will have to be spent by the student on take-home hardware kits that will be used during some workshops (Anno Domini 2023 amount; correct for inflation for subsequent years after that).

# Student-for-student hours

During the minor, there will be up to two official Open Days and one official Minor Market.

At the Minor Coordinator’s request, each team will provide one student for each of these events. The Coordinator may set a specific condition such as the bachelor programme this student follows.

Our minor gets lots of resources from the Faculty, you are a special (and expensive) bunch. Therefore, doing this little thing in return really is reasonable.

# Online project tracking website

As the minor commences, you will be given access to a SMR online learning website.

The main purpose is allowing teachers, other students and clients insight in the progression of your project. It also allows easy communication among the parties involved.

Make sure to upload all major deliverables to your own project's topic. Also keep notes of the tutor meetings in there.

# From the Project Roadmap:

Copy-paste the entire project plan below _**into the top of your first post**_ of your own project topic, and fill it out.

> **You can copy-paste [this page](https://www.robotexchange.io/raw/2625)**

Adding your private email and LinkedIn to this table are optional, but highly recommended. It makes it easier for your current classmates and teachers to add you to their contact list, so that you might be contacted easily after you've left the university. (We added this feature due to feedback of former students.)

## [ ] Note to the students

[wrap=roadmap]

**Red underlines**

See the red underline in the button below? That means you have to fill out something.

- `Things that are underlined like this have to be replaced by the students.`

Usually, it's either putting some text in like a name, or inserting a link to your deliverable.

You can remove the underlines by editing the post and clearing the enclosing <kbd>`</kbd> signs.

# From: a typical Request for Projects call from Smart Manufacturing & Robotics Minor (sent out 4 times a year:)

🇳🇱 ROBOTISERINGS-PROJECTEN GEZOCHT (KOSTENLOOS)
🇺🇸 LOOKING FOR FOR ROBOTICS PROJECTS (FREE)

Check out this video by our current students to see what they built over the last two months!

You too can get your industrial  minor prototype built by our students FOR FREE!

Our 4th year HBO technical students from The Hague University, location Delft, are looking for automation projects again.

All we ask for is 'goed opdrachtgeverschap' (being a good client), and the understanding that a short video of the project will be published to social media afterwards.*

📅 nov-20 ❗𝐃𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐄 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐉𝐄𝐂𝐓 𝐒𝐔𝐁𝐌𝐈𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐅𝐎𝐑 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐏𝐀𝐍𝐈𝐄𝐒❗
📅 nov-21 Students contact you from today onwards to figure out what you want 📞
📅 nov-28 Deadline agreement between students and you: Your project will be done yes/no
📅 dec-02 Students start on your project 🚀. Usually at your company, but in exceptional circumstances we can do it at the University. 

... 6 weeks of building by our students and then ...

📅 jan-28 DELIVERY/DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROTOTYPE TO YOU by our students 🎉

It's great if you're a Dutch company not too far from Delft, but we do accept projects from all Holland... and the world. In that case we'll build the prototype in our lab and contact will take place over the internet.

You don't have to know exactly what you need yet. If you're unsure, we'll send a few of our students over to your company to figure out how they can help you best.

𝗪𝗘 𝗖𝗔𝗡 𝗕𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗥𝗢𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗦

Don't have your own robots or hardware yet? No problem, because we are bringing our own robot arm for the duration of the project if you don't have one.

Note: Use of a robot is not required, any challenging automation problem qualifies.

𝗦𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗗𝗦 𝗚𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗧, 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘 𝗖𝗔𝗡 𝗜 𝗦𝗜𝗚𝗡 𝗨𝗣? 🎯

Go and sign up at:

It's okay if you're unsure what automation project would be best to tackle. In that case, just tell us that you've got automation challenges and you want our students to figure out how they can help you.

𝗪𝗛𝗬 𝗔𝗥𝗘 𝗪𝗘 𝗗𝗢𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗧𝗛𝗜𝗦 𝗙𝗢𝗥 𝗙𝗥𝗘𝗘?

Our projects are done WITHOUT requiring money from companies or having to apply to additional subsidies. Regular government funds the University receives to train students are sufficient due to our streamlined efficiency.

We have students, hardware, knowledge &  minor experts, you have the actual real-world automation project. It is in our student's interest to bring those two together.
